# 🌟 AI Adventure Game - Living World Engine

## 📋 Overview

A revolutionary browser-based AI-powered adventure game where autonomous AI characters live their own lives in a persistent world. Watch them form relationships, pursue goals, and create emergent stories - then jump in to adventure alongside them! The game runs entirely locally with beautiful pixel art tilesets and no servers required.

**What makes this unique:** Combines AI Town's living world concept with actual adventure game mechanics, featuring real-time tileset rendering, multi-screen exploration, and seamless Observer/Adventure mode switching.

## 🎯 Configuration

### Key Settings (config.js)
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    TILE_SIZE: 32,           // Standard tile size
    CANVAS_WIDTH: 800,       // Game viewport width
    CANVAS_HEIGHT: 600,      // Game viewport height
    DAY_LENGTH: 24000,       // Day duration (24 seconds)
    TICK_RATE: 60,           // Target FPS
    PLAYER_SPEED: 3,         // Player movement speed
    DEBUG_MODE: true         // Show debug panel
};
```

### Map Structure
Maps are loaded from JSON files with tileset references:
- **Layers**: ground, buildings, objects, trees, overlay
- **Collision**: Auto-generated from layer rules
- **Tilesets**: Dynamically loaded PNG files with GID mapping

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Tileset not loading**
- Check that PNG files exist in `assets/tilesets/`
- Verify map JSON files reference correct tileset names
- Look for 404 errors in browser console

**Objects behind buildings**
- Ensure renderer.js has correct layer order: `['ground', 'buildings', 'objects', 'trees']`
- Check that both renderer and worldEngine use same layer ordering

**JavaScript files not found**
- Verify `<script src="js/main.js">` path in index.html
- Ensure all JS files are in the `js/` folder
- Check for ES6 module import/export syntax errors

**Debug panel not showing**
- Set `CONFIG.DEBUG_MODE = true` in config.js
- Click "Debug" button in game controls
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Performance Optimization
- Game runs at 60 FPS target with dynamic timestep
- Tileset loading is cached and reused
- Only current screen entities are updated
- Collision detection uses efficient tile-based system
